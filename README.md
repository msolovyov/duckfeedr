Project Details:
A scientist is trying to understand how ducks are being fed in parks around the world. She wants
to collect the following information:
● What time the ducks are fed
● What food the ducks are fed
● Where the ducks are fed
● How many ducks are fed
● What kind of food the ducks are fed
● How much food the ducks are fed
● Nice to have: the ability for a little old lady who feeds the ducks every day in the same
way to set a repeating schedule so she doesn’t have to use the application every day
The scientist would like to crowdsource this information by creating a web application where
people can submit these data points. The scientist would like to be able to do reporting on the
data for her PhD thesis.
